# `catcsv`: Concatenate directories of possibly-compressed CSV files

This is a small utility that we use to reassemble many small CSV files into
much larger ones.  In our case, the small CSV files are generated by
highly-parallel by [Pachyderm][] pipelines doing map/reduce-style
operations.

Usage:

```
catcsv - Combine many CSV files into one

Usage:
  catcsv <input-file-or-dir>...
  catcsv (--help | --version)

Options:
  --help        Show this screen.
  --version     Show version.

Input files must have the extension *.csv or *.csv.sz.  The latter are assumed
to be in Google's "snappy framed" format: https://github.com/google/snappy

If passed a directory, this will recurse over all files in that directory.
```

## Wish list

If you'd like to add support for other common compression formats, such as `*.gz`,
we'll happily accept PRs that depend on either pure Rust crates, or which
include C code in the crate but still cross-compile easily with musl.

- BurntSushi's excellent [xsv][] utility, which features a wide variety of
  subcommands for working with CSV files.  Among these is a powerful `xsv
  cat` command, which has many options that `catcsv` doesn't (but which
  doesn't do directory walking or automatic decompression as far as I
  know).
- Faraday's [scrubcsv][] utility, which attempts to normalize non-standard
  CSV files.
