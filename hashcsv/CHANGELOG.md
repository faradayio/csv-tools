## [0.1.1] - 2017-02-09

### Changed

- Inner loop optimized, raising throughput from ~256 KiB/s to 65 MiB/s. I had suspected that two memory allocations per CSV row were slowing us down, but I am surprised that eliminating them improved performance by a factor of _250Ã—_. As always, `malloc` is highly expensive in hot loops.

## [0.1.0] - 2017-02-05

### Added

- Initial release for internal use. This was only released as manually-built binaries.
