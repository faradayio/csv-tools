## [1.0.0] - 2022-05-25

### Added

- Official 1.0.0 release, because this program has been used in production for years.
- `--clean-column-names=stable` provides a new column-name-cleaning algorithm. This converts ASCII characters to lowercase, converts spaces to `_`, and verifies that the resulting column name is a unique, valid C identifier. The goal of this new column name cleaner is to make our output column names easily predictable.
- `--reserve-column-names=REGEX` will cause `scrubcsv` to fail if it would generate output columns matching `REGEX`.
- Binary builds for more platforms, including M1.

## [0.1.9] - 2020-07-14

### Added

- Write bad row info to debug log.
